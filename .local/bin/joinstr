# Join arguments into a single string using the first argument as a separator.

# USAGE
#
#   joinstr SEPARATOR STRING...
#

sep="$1"; shift

# Characters with special meaning in printf format string must be escaped.
# The length before escaping is the length after formatting.
n=${#sep}
sep="${sep//%/%%}"
sep="${sep//\\/\\\\}"

# The real deal. All the rest is input sanitation. If you control your
# separator, you only need the following two lines.
printf -v str -- "${sep}%s" "$@"
echo "${str:n}" # Remove leading separator
